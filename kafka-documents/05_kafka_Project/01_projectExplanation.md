# Real-World Kafka Implementation Project

## Introduction

In this section, we will leverage our Kafka skills to implement a real-world project. This involves programming, but there will also be a lot of emphasis on Kafka-specific concepts.

## Project Overview

We get data from widkimedia through kafka producer into kafka topics. The consumer takes these data and sends this data to OpenSearch.
